Returns an array of all logs matching a given filter object.


### Body

<ParamField body="id" type="number" placeholder="1">
  Serves as a unique identifier for the request
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="jsonrpc" type="string" placeholder="2.0">
  Indicates the version of JSON-RPC being used
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="method" type="string" placeholder="eth_getLogs">
  Represents the name of the remote procedure or method to be called
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="params" type="object">
    Contains the list of parameters passed to the remote method.

    <Expandable title="params">

        <ParamField body="fromBlock" type="string or number">
            Integer block number, or "latest" for the last mined block or "pending", "earliest" for not yet mined
            transactions.
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField body="toBlock" type="string or number">
            Integer block number, or "latest" for the last mined block or "pending", "earliest" for not yet mined
            transactions.
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField body="address" type="string or array">
            20 Bytes - (optional) Contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField body="topics" type="array">
            (Optional) Array of 32 Bytes DATA topics. Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be an array of
            DATA with "or" options.
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField body="blockhash" type="string">
            32 Bytes - (optional, future) With the addition of EIP-234, blockHash will be a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash blockHash. Using blockHash is equivalent to fromBlock = toBlock = the block number with hash blockHash. If blockHash is present in the filter criteria, then neither fromBlock nor toBlock are allowed.
